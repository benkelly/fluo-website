<div id="post-content">
  <p>Fluo has a <a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/fluo/blob/acf1ea7d8d6bc74eef7e311008e5e8fc0fd94d30/modules/stress/README.md">stress test</a> which computes the number of unique integers
through the process of building a bitwise trie.  Multiple collections of
randomly generated integers are provided as input.  The test suite includes a
simple map reduce job that can read the same data fed to Fluo and compute the
number of unique integers. The correctness of Fluo can be verified by checking
the result in Fluo against the map reduce job.  The test is intended to
exercise Fluo at scale and complements the unit and integration test.  One of
our goals before releasing beta is to run this test on clusters for long
periods of time.  This post records the experience of running the stress test
overnight on a cluster for the first time.</p>

<p>For this test run, initially ~1 billion random integers were generated and
loaded into Fluo via map reduce.  After that ~100K random integers were
repeatedly loaded 120 times, sleeping 2 minutes between loads.  After
everything finished, the test was a success. The number of unique integers
computed independently by MapReduce matched the number computed by Fluo. Below
is the output of the stress test count from Fluo.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> $ java -cp $STRESS_JAR io.fluo.stress.trie.Print $FLUO_PROPS
 Total at root : 1011489250
 Nodes Scanned : 59605
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Below are a few lines of output selected from the map reduce job.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> Map input records=1011999273
 io.fluo.stress.trie.Unique$Stats 
    UNIQUE=1011489250
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This output shows that 1,011,999,273 random integers (between 0 and
10<sup>12</sup>-1) were given to Fluo and map reduce.  Both computations
reported 1,011,489,250 unique integers.</p>

<h2 id="graphite-plots">Graphite Plots</h2>

<p>Before running the overnight test, a quick test with only a few iterations was
run against an empty table.  This initial test went well and had no problems
keeping up.  Based on that quick test, the decision was made load 100K random
integers into Fluo every two minutes for 120 iterations.  However a big
difference between the quick test and the long running test, was that the long
running test did not start with an empty table. What worked well for an empty
table did not work well for a table with a billion initial entries.  The long
running test was kicked off in the evening, giving EC2 something to do in the
wee hours.</p>

<p>In the morning the long running test was still running, but had fallen behind.
The image below shows transaction committed per minute and covers a 15 hour
period.  Unfortunately this image does not include the load transactions, there
was a problem getting that reported to Graphite.  So only Observer transactions
are shown in the plot.</p>

<p>The image below shows notifications queued and covers a 15 hour period.</p>

<p><img src="/resources/blog/stress_1/queue-1.png" alt="Notifications Queued" title="Notifications Queued" /></p>

<p>Upon seeing that the test was falling behind, fiddling with it was unavoidable.
The table was configured to use bloom filters and a compaction forced, with the
hope that this would lead to less file accesses.  This caused performance to
drop for some reason.  Since that did not work, different bloom filter setting
were set and another round of compactions forced.  The new settings caused
tablet servers to start dying with out of memory errors.  The Fluo workers
continued to limp along using a subset of tablet servers.   The fiddling and
futzing was declared a failure, bloom filter settings reverted, another round
of compactions issued, and tservers restarted.  Around the time the fiddling
ended, so did the map reduce jobs that were loading new data.  It was very
satisfying that the counts came out correct after all of this disruptive
activity.</p>

<p>The plots below cover a 21 hour period and overlap in the 1st 15 hours with the
plots above.  The drops in performance are due to the previously mentioned
shenanigans.  The dramatic recovery is due to load transactions finishing and
compacting away bloom filters.</p>

<p>The plot below shows transactions committed per minute.</p>

<p><img src="/resources/blog/stress_1/committed-2.png" alt="TXs committed 2" title="TX Committed per minute" /></p>

<p>The image below shows notifications queued.</p>

<p><img src="/resources/blog/stress_1/queue-2.png" alt="Notifications Queued 2" title="Notifications Queued 2" /></p>

<p>Something mysterious in the plot above is the difference between min and max
queue sizes.  To investigate, Graphite was used to plot each workers queue size
over time.  This plot is shown below.  Its hard to see from the plot, but 10
workers start falling behind almost immediately and 7 did not.  No idea what
happened here.</p>

<h2 id="test-environment">Test Environment</h2>

<p>The test was run on 20 m1.large EC2 nodes using the script at the end of this
<a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/fluo/blob/acf1ea7d8d6bc74eef7e311008e5e8fc0fd94d30/modules/stress/README.md">README</a>.  The parameters in the script were set as follows, the for loop
was changed to <code class="highlighter-rouge">{1..120}</code>, and the sleep time was set to 120.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>MAX=$((10**12))
SPLITS=68
MAPS=17
REDUCES=17
GEN_INIT=$((10**9))
GEN_INCR=$((10**5))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The following was used to run the test :</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/keith-turner/stress-balancer">Custom balancer</a></li>
  <li><a href="/resources/blog/stress_1/accumulo-site.xml">accumulo-site.xml</a></li>
  <li><a href="/resources/blog/stress_1/fluo.properties">fluo.properties</a></li>
  <li><a href="/resources/blog/stress_1/table_settings.txt">Table settings</a></li>
  <li>Fluo from commit acf1ea7d8d6bc74eef7e311008e5e8fc0fd94d30</li>
  <li>Accumulo 1.6.1</li>
  <li>Hadoop 2.6.0</li>
  <li>Centos 6.5</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>We are very happy the counts came out correct especially since some tablet
servers died (which was unplanned).  In a later test, we can hopefully kill
tablet servers, Fluo workers, and datanodes.</p>

<p>Looking at the numbers leads to the question: was the performance good?  At
this point that is unclear.   Need to get a sense of what the theoretical
maximum rate would be based on basic performance characteristics of nodes.
That mathematical model does not exist at the moment.</p>

<p>The particular EC2 nodes used in this experiment are not very speedy.  A single
high end workstation can match the performance of these 20 nodes, however
scaling issue will never be seen on a single node.  The m1.large nodes were
used because they were cheap.  Many scaling issue were found using these nodes.
After working out bugs on the cheaper nodes, we may run experiments using more
expensive, high performance EC2 nodes.  However this will depend on <a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/fluo/issues/356">#356</a>
which should make that process easier.  The current 20 node m1.large setup was
partially manually setup.</p>

<p>Further experiments could be done adjusting various Accumulo and Fluo settings,
like number of threads.  Also, it will be interesting to see what impact
implementing issues like <a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/fluo/issues/12">#12</a> will have.</p>
