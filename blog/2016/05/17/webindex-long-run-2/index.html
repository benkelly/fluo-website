<div id="post-content">
  <p>Another long run of <a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/webindex">Webindex</a> was done to test changes made since beta-2
and it went well.  This run performed much better than the previous the
<a href="/blog/2016/01/11/webindex-long-run/">previous long run of Webindex</a>.  The experiment was run on 21 EC2
m3-xlarge nodes (20 worker nodes).  Each node has 4 cores and 15G of RAM.
273.6 million web pages and 3.54 billion links were processed from 8,000 common
crawl files (each file is around 330M).  It took around 80 hours to load the
files resulting in a rate of ~950 web page/sec and ~12,292 links/sec.</p>

<p>This blog post outlines the changes to Fluo, Fluo Recipes, and Webindex that
made this long run so much better than the last one.  For anyone writing
applications on Fluo, the changes to Webindex that resulted in improvements may
be of interest.  Unreleased versions of Fluo and Fluo Recipes were used for
this test, so the improvements are not easily available to users yet.  However
we hope to release new versions soon.</p>

<h2 id="rate-limited-page-loading">Rate limited page loading</h2>

<p>The plot below shows how many transactions per second were executed by
different observers.  Please refer to the <a href="/blog/2016/01/11/webindex-long-run/#webindex-overview">overview in the last
post</a> for a description of the observers and see the <a href="/blog/2016/01/11/webindex-long-run/#grafana-plots">previous
plots</a>.  The transactions per second is very even compared to the
last run.   The document load rate was limited to a maximum of 1,000 pages per
second.  There was no limit in the last run, it just ran as fast as it could.</p>

<p><img src="/resources/blog/webindex_run_201605/wilr2-tps.png" alt="Transactions per second plot" /></p>

<p>The PageLoader is not show in the plot above because of a bug with it in the
historical view.  In the recent Grafana view it plotted fine and basically
mirrored the PageObserver.</p>

<p>The ability to rate limit page loading was added in <a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/webindex/issues/70">webindex-70</a>.  For this
test run 20 Spark load task were run, each limited to 50 pages per second.  The
latest code can sustain much higher rates initially (see <a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/fluo/issues/593#issuecomment-213630145">this
comment</a>).  However once a lot of data builds up,
compactions and scans in Accumulo start taking more CPU.  A rate of 1,000 pages
per second was chosen as something that could be sustained over multiple days.
The CPU plots below show that in the beginning there is idle CPU to spare, but
that does not last.</p>

<h2 id="cpu-utilization">CPU Utilization</h2>

<p>In order to get higher throughput changes were made to reduce CPU usage and
evenly spread CPU usage across the cluster.  The following plot shows the CPU
usage of all nodes across the cluster during the test.  Unfortunately this data
was not kept for the previous run.  One issue that caused problems in the
previous run was hotpots, where one node was swamped while others were under
utilized.  In this run the utilization across the cluster was fairly uniform.</p>

<p><img src="/resources/blog/webindex_run_201605/wilr2-cpu.png" alt="CPU usage plots" /></p>

<p>The following evenly spread computation :</p>

<ul>
  <li>A short hash was appended to URLs used as the row key for pages.  This
spread web pages evenly across the cluster.  These changes were made in
<a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/webindex/issues/49">webindex-49</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/fluo-recipes/issues/45">fluo-recipes-45</a>.</li>
  <li>The webindex query table schema was changed in <a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/webindex/issues/71">webindex-71</a> to allow large
rows to split.  Before this change compactions of large tablets that could
not split were causing uneven CPU utilization.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following reduced CPU usage :</p>

<ul>
  <li>The two Accumulo tables (Fluo and query table) were configured to use Snappy
instead of GZip.</li>
  <li>In <a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/fluo/issues/623">fluo-623</a> the Fluo iterators that run in Accumulo were optimized to
sometimes seek.  This resulted in scanning less data in Accumulo to execute
transactions and find notifications.</li>
  <li>In <a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/webindex/issues/54">webindex-54</a> parsing links was sped up, using less CPU.</li>
  <li>Accumulo 1.7.1 was used which has <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-4066">ACCUMULO-4066</a>.  This made processing
conditional mutations less CPU intensive.</li>
</ul>

<p>There were 20 worker nodes and 1 master node.  The master node was running the
namenode, zookeeper, resource manager, Accumulo master, Grafana, and InfluxDB.
The master node was normally lightly loaded.  However, at one point InfluxDB
was burning lots of CPU for an extended period.  This impacted the namenode,
which impacted the entire cluster.  Not sure what InfluxDB was doing, maybe
something like a compaction.  May put it on its own node in future test.</p>

<p>The following table shows how the 8,000 files were loaded by 5 spark jobs.
After each Spark job completed the two tables were compacted.  Compacting the
query table prevented expensive compactions from occurring during the next load.
Compacting the Fluo table cleaned up transaction bookkeeping data.  The
compactions explain why the CPU utilization is low when the jobs first start.</p>

<h2 id="preventing-yarn-from-killing-workers">Preventing YARN from killing workers</h2>

<p>In the previous run Fluo worker processes were constantly being killed by YARN
for exceeding memory limits.  This would cause transactions to have to be
rolled back.  With the new asynchronous commit changes discussed below a lot of
committing transactions could be in flight.  Frequently killing processes with
lots of committing transactions would cause lots of rollbacks.</p>

<p>This problem was remedied in <a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/fluo/issues/593">fluo-593</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/zetten/pull/139">zetten-139</a>.  For this run the
workers were given 5.5G with 1.5G reserved.  With these settings no workers
were killed by YARN.  When workers are killed it causes upward spikes in the
memory plots.  There are no spikes of individual workers like this in the
memory plots below.</p>

<p><img src="/resources/blog/webindex_run_201605/wilr2-memory.png" alt="Memory usage plots" /></p>

<p>Twill reserved memory was set by adding the following to yarn-site.xml.
<a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/fluo/issues/671">fluo-671</a> was opened to investigate a better way of setting this.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  &lt;property&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;twill.java.reserved.memory.mb&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;value&gt;1536&lt;/value&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The following was set in fluo.properties.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  io.fluo.worker.max.memory.mb=5632
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This resulted in workers running with a max heap size of 4096M.  The processes
will grow larger than 4096M, but will not be killed by YARN unless exceeding
5632M.</p>

<h2 id="asynchronous-commits">Asynchronous commits</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/fluo/issues/593">fluo-593</a> commit processing was rewritten using an asynchronous model.
There is no longer a single thread walking each transaction through the commit
steps.  Instead many transactions are put on a queue for each step and
processed by a few threads.  This allows many more transactions to be
concurrently committing.   With this model a temporary pause or high CPU load
on a tablet server does not lower throughput.  Before this change, when
tservers spiked to 100% this would impact many committing transactions and the
threads running those transactions.  Those threads would wait.  This would lead
to lower utilization across the cluster.</p>

<p>The plot below shows the number of transactions committing.  As the CPU
utilization increase, so does the number of committing transactions.  With the
high CPU utilization it takes longer for individual transactions to commit, but
throughput is maintained.</p>

<p><img src="/resources/blog/webindex_run_201605/wilr2-committing.png" alt="Committing transactions plot" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately the plot does not have all data because it was based on recent
data which ages off.  The historical plots for committing transactions is not
yet implemented.  See <a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/fluo/issues/653">fluo-653</a>.</p>

<p>Asynchronous commits offer higher throughput but also increase the commit time
of individual transactions.  As outlined in <a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/fluo/issues/650">fluo-650</a> this can lead to
increased lock wait time when one transaction is waiting on another.  This
problem was partially solved by <a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/fluo/issues/654">fluo-654</a> which executes older notifications
first.  For Webindex, executing older transactions first works well for the
page data.  However for the Collision Free Maps and Export Queue buckets that
are always being updated, it does not work so well.   A transaction processing
these buckets will usually have lock wait.  The number of buckets was set at
half the total number of worker threads with the thought that this would
usually leave some threads to process pages.  Not sure if this was helpful.  A
better solution to <a href="https://github.com/fluo-io/fluo/issues/650">fluo-650</a> is needed.  Below is a plot of lock wait time.</p>

<p><img src="/resources/blog/webindex_run_201605/wilr2-lockwait.png" alt="Lock wait time plot" /></p>

<h2 id="read-and-write-plots">Read and Write plots</h2>

<p>Below are plots of the amount data read and written per second by different
Observers.</p>

<p><img src="/resources/blog/webindex_run_201605/wilr2-erps.png" alt="Cells read per second" />
<img src="/resources/blog/webindex_run_201605/wilr2-esps.png" alt="Cells written per second" /></p>

<h2 id="accumulo-settings">Accumulo Settings</h2>

<p>The following were executed in the Accumulo shell after initializing Fluo but
before starting the first Spark load job.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>config -t webindex -s table.compaction.major.ratio=1.75
config -t webindex -s table.file.compress.blocksize.index=256K
config -t webindex -s table.file.compress.blocksize=64K
config -t webindex -s table.file.compress.type=snappy
config -t webindex_search -s table.file.compress.type=snappy
config -t webindex_search -s table.split.threshold=512M
config -t accumulo.metadata -s table.durability=flush
config -t accumulo.root -s table.durability=flush
config -s tserver.wal.replication=2
config -s table.file.replication=2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Fluo used the <code class="highlighter-rouge">webindex</code> table.  A blocksize of 64k was selected to speed up
random lookups a bit.  A compaction ratio of 1.75 was chosen so that the Fluo
table would compact more frequently.  Compactions of the Fluo table run the
Fluo garbage collection iterator.</p>

<p>Webindex uses the <code class="highlighter-rouge">webindex_search</code> table for queries and Fluo exports to it.
This table uses real data like domain names and URLs, therefore the data does
not spread evenly.  Lowering the split from the default of 1G to 512M makes
tablets with popular domains or URLs split and spread across the cluster
sooner.</p>

<p>Data replication was set to 2 because the cluster did not have a lot of space
and the default of 3 may have filled it up.</p>

<p>The Accumulo tserver were configured with a data cache of 3G and an index cache
of 512M.</p>

<p>At some point later in the test, the number of compaction threads in Accumulo was
adjusted from 3 to 2.  This was done because there were only 4 cores and having
compactions use most of them could be disruptive.</p>

<h2 id="fluo-settings">Fluo Settings</h2>

<p>Fluo was configured with 128 threads per worker and 20 workers.</p>

<p>For the test the following was set in fluo.properties.  This settings
determines the maximum amount of transactions that will be held in memory to
commit asynchronously.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>io.fluo.impl.tx.commit.memory=104857600
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="webindex-settings">Webindex settings</h2>

<p>Webindex was configured with the following settings.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>numTablets: 60
numBuckets: 1020
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each type of data started with 60 tablets.  The types of data are page data,
url inlink counts, domain url counts, and the export queue.  1,020 is multiple
of 60 giving each tablet the same number of buckets.  With 60 tablets, each
tablet server started off with 3 tablets per data type.   Some of the data
types split as the test ran.</p>

<h2 id="final-data-size">Final Data Size</h2>

<p>After loading all of the data the two tables were compacted.  The size of the
tables is shown below.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@instance16&gt; du webindex
         291,525,943,501 [webindex]
root@instance16&gt; du webindex_search
         271,106,371,976 [webindex_search]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Postmortem analysis of the RFiles from this test run lead to work on
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-1124">ACCUMULO-1124</a> and <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-4314">ACCUMULO-4314</a>.</p>
